I like to use youtube for research but sometimes I just dont have time to watch the videos in real time. I needed a utility to download the videos so I could watch them off line. This allows me to watch on my laptop when I am in an area the blocks youtube or I dont have internet access. 

Add the URLs you would like to download to the videos.txt file. Once there execute the script and wait. 

'''python
./yt-bulk-download.py
